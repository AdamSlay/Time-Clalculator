# Time-Clalculator
A micro-project that takes a given Time, Duration, and Day as input and outputs the Time and Day after the Duration has passed.

Ex. Input: ("3:10 PM", "3:00", "Monday") ->  Output: "6:10 PM, Monday"

This was one of the final projects of the Free Code Camp course: Scientific Computing with Python. As such, it was a completely
unguided project and was submitted to the course for testing. 

# Primary Goals
1. Write clean/readable code
2. Maneuver the filesystem with the terminal
3. Utilize git to create and maintain a remote repository
4. Practice vim commands in VS Code
5. Practice mouseless operation of the PC in general
6. Build the project using what I've learned rather than looking things up

# Video-Log
I made this project while recording daily logs of my coding progress for a series called Coding Every Day for 100 Days.
This project took place over days 72-74 and took about 3 hours to complete in total. The video-log can be found at the following URL:
